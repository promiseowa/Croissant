      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by
      the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
      laminated dough.
      <br />
      The best quality croissants of all keep their premium quality for up to
      four weeks on the shelf. The challenge for industrial manufacturers, of
      course, is to make sure their soft croissants are just as fresh and
      appealing on their sell-by date as they were the day after baking.

      Yes, you can freeze croissants for up to 2 months. To freeze croissants,
      place them onto a baking tray and into the freezer for a few hours to
      freeze. Once frozen, transfer them to a bag and freeze.
